                Tendering and Outsourcing activities for large Energy Assets are
                generally done inhouse. There are arguments in favour of such
                decision. We have taken a closer look to understand the
                advantages of having inhouse Tenders. We selected top 4 criteria
                that drive performance: Scope of Work, KPI, Evaluation and
                Remuneration models. Following are our observations:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc ml-5">
                <li className="mb-2">
                  30% tenders were freshly made with correct parameters
                </li>
                <li className="mb-2">
                  7% tenders were a one on one copy from the old tender
                </li>
                <li className="mb-2">
                  In 22% cases, old scope of work was used without revision
                </li>
                <li className="mb-2">
                  10% cases, old evaluation models were applied despite changing
                  cost and value drivers
                </li>
                <li className="mb-2">
                  11% of the tenders had old KPIs which conflicted with the
                  delivery requirements
                </li>
                <li className="mb-2">
                  And in 20% tenders, previous remuneration model was applied

              <p className="mb-3">
                Evaluation model is one of the key defence barriers for any
                Project Manager. It helps to objectively choose the right
                Contractor.

                Remuneration Model:
              </h5>
              <p className="mb-3">
                Remuneration is one of the key tools to drive proper Contract
